# Sysinfocus DCSS
Dynamic CSS (`dcss.js`) is a lightweight JavaScript utility that enables developers to **create and manage inline styles, element-level styles, and CSS classes dynamically** using custom HTML attributes. It streamlines styling logic directly in the markup, removing the need for manually updating or managing external stylesheets in fast-paced, component-driven applications.

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ **Dynamic Classes (`dc`)** – Define reusable class rules directly in HTML attributes.
- 🎯 **Dynamic Element Styles (`de`)** – Apply element-level styles.
- 📄 **Dynamic Styles (`ds`)** – Insert dynamic, global style blocks via attributes.
- 🔁 Fully JavaScript-powered – Just include the script and you're ready.
- ⚡ Zero dependencies – Tiny, fast, and modular.
- 📦 Ideal for SPAs, PWAs, demos, and embedded apps.

💡 Also supports **responsive breakpoints** like `xs-ds`, `sm-ds`, `md-ds`, `lg-ds`, `xl-ds` and `xxl-ds`, for device-based styling!

## 🔥 Why Dynamic CSS?

Traditional CSS can become rigid and unscalable in modern component-driven workflows. `dcss.js` allows developers to:

✅ **Style without creating external CSS files**  
✅ **Write scoped, atomic styles inline or dynamically**  
✅ **Create reusable classes using HTML attributes `dc` and `ds` which can be used with `class` for reusability.**  
✅ **Prototype rapidly and keep style logic near the component**  
✅ **Manage responsive styling without media query clutter**

Perfect for:

- Single File Components
- Web Components
- SPAs and PWAs
- Prototypes and demos
- CodePen/JSFiddle playgrounds
